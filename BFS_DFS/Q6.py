Q6:
This problem is about cycle finding as discussed in Section 12.3 of the unit notes.
(a) Exlpain using an example why the algorithm given for finding cycles in an undirected graph does not work
when applied to a directed graph
(b) Describe an algorithm based on depth-first search that determines whether a given directed graph contains
any cycles. Your algorithm should run in O(V+E) time. Write psuedocode for your algorithm
